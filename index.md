# Acme PHP

Acme PHP is a simple yet very extensible command line tool that will let you get
and renew free HTTPS certificates.

It works with the [Let's Encrypt certificate authority](https://letsencrypt.org/),
using the [ACME protocol](https://github.com/letsencrypt/acme-spec). In a few steps,
you will be able to get a trusted certificate for any domain, freely and easily.

[Start by installing Acme PHP and getting your first certificate!](/documentation/getting-started/1-installation.html)
